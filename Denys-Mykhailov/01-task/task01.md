# Practical Assignment 01: Writing Complex Select Queries üìù

This task is part of the Database course at KSE University. It focuses on practicing complex SQL queries involving multiple table joins, filtering, grouping, and ordering data.

## Task Overview üìÑ

- **Basic Requirements (5 points)**:
    - Write a complex `SELECT` query that joins 5 tables.
    - Use `WHERE` to filter the data based on specific conditions.
    - Apply `GROUP BY` to group the data and perform aggregate functions.
    - Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results.

- **Additional Points (2 points)**:
    - **+0.5**: Source code published in GitHub or GitLab.
    - **+0.5**: Implement `UNION` or `UNION ALL` to combine results from multiple queries.
    - **+1**: Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) for organizing complex queries.

## Learning Outcomes üéØ

- Gain proficiency in writing complex `SELECT` queries with multiple joins.
- Understand the importance of `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses in query structure.
- Familiarize yourself with `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, and **CTE** for additional query functionality.

## Notes üìù

- Ensure all five tables are correctly joined in the query.
- Double-check the logic in `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to meet the task requirements.
